Converts Beat Saber maps into OSU! maps.

I included a run.bat which launches the thing, but obviously it requires you to install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Launch it, select the beat saber map file (.zip), and it will generate OSU! file (.osz) next to it and close. 

I made this so that I could use beat sage without owning beat saber. **Recommended beat sage settings are: all events disabled**, the rest doesn't seem to matter. It might work well on human made beatmaps, but keep in mind that it only converts normal notes and ignores all events.

There are no sliders or anything, converted beatmaps are literally copies of beat saber beatmaps but in osu.
